### 👋 Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph
"elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is
addressing.

### 👊 Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is
that some current API or pattern is currently cumbersome or clumsy, show how one
can currently achieve the desired functionality and describe its drawbacks. If
it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate why this new
functionality would help improve the project.

### 📓 Proposal

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they
work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner,
safer, or more efficient?

### 🤓 Implementation

Describe the design of the solution in detail. The detail in this section should
be sufficient for someone who is not one of the authors to be able to reasonably
implement the feature.

### 💣 Impact

If this enhancement is integrated, how will it affect the project and existing
codebase / API. Will it break compatibility?

### ⚖️ Alternatives

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you
chose this approach instead.
